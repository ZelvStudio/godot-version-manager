## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Requirements

This has been developped with `python3.11`, it does not work with older versions of Python 3. If necessary, install it from your package manager as well as `pip` for Python 3.

<!--- Seems unnecessary 
The package uses `argcomplete` to autocomplete arguments. Install it on your system using:

```
# on Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
```
--->

#### Clone git repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gaheldev/godot-version-manager.git
cd godot-version-manager
```

#### Set up virtualenv (recommended)

We use virtualenv to create an environment with controlled python package versions. 


```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure to run `source venv/bin/activate` before working on the project. <br>
Run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtualenv.

#### Install godot-version-manager on your system

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
