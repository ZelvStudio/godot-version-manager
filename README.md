# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gaheldev/godot-version-manager/releases/latest) and extract it.  
Install `gdvm` by running the install script from the extracted directory:

```
cd gdvm
./install.sh
```

>[!NOTE]
> If you encounter a glibc error follow the [install instructions for developers](#set-up-the-development-environment)

<br></br>

---

# üìù Basic usage

>[!NOTE]
> Run ```gdvm -h``` for advanced usage
<br/>

## Set a Godot version to use for current working directory

```
gdvm download VERSION_NUMBER --release RELEASE
gdvm use --local VERSION
```

Gvm supports autocompletion of all arguments including all possible version and release names.  
Alternatively you can use the interactive version of the commands:
```
gdvm download
gdvm use --local
```

>[!NOTE]
> The local version is written to `.godotversion` in the current working directory. 
> Track it with git ;) 
<br/>

## Set a managed version as system's default
```
gdvm use --system-default VERSION
```
or for the interactive version:
```
gdvm use --system-default
```

Both running ```godot``` in the terminal or opening Godot's desktop application will point to the new installed version.  
<br/>


## Run Godot

* `gdvm run` runs the current working directory's project with project's version if it has been previously defined, otherwise asks to select the version to run.
  
* `gdvm run VERSION` to run a specific version
  
* `gdvm run --system` to run the system's default

# ‚å®Ô∏è Development

## Set up the development environment

>[!IMPORTANT]
> `python > 3.11` is required. If necessary, install it from your package manager as well as `pip` for Python 3.
<br/>

<!--- Seems unnecessary 
The package uses `argcomplete` to autocomplete arguments. Install it on your system using:

```
# on Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
```
--->

#### Clone git repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gaheldev/godot-version-manager.git
cd godot-version-manager
```

#### Set up virtualenv (recommended)

We use virtualenv to create an environment with controlled python package versions. 


```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure to run `source venv/bin/activate` before working on the project. <br>
Run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtualenv.

#### Install gdvm on your system

```
./build.sh
./install.sh
```


## Tests

Tests are located in the `tests/` folder of the project. All test files should be named 'test_*.py' or '*_test.py'.

Run `pytest` in the project's root directory to run all tests. 

#### Automatically run tests before any commit

> [!WARNING]
> this will delete any pre-commit hook you already created
```
chmod +x pre-commit-hook.sh
./pre-commit-hook.sh
```

If you already have a pre-commit hook set up, just add the line `pytest` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
